Some people don't care about languages? why? Cause they thought other languages is sucks (for a fanatic) but some people says is hard.
but for me learning other languages is fun, cause i can have many friends to other country. now i just want to share how fun it is.

4 Years ago i started learn new languages beside chinese and english, I start with learn Thai.
For awhile i thought Thai is hard until 1 years after that I know Vietnamese from Online friends in TalkTalk (Garena Online Platform Chat).
I get more native Vietnamese friends then I learn more about that languages, in same years with that Platform from Garena I meet Friends from Taiwan, SG, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand.
From that time I learn how to talk and interact with other people using their languages.
But at all I love to know more a culture, and this made me having experienced to future.
